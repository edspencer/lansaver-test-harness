# LANsaver test harness

This is a simple Express server that mocks out endpoints for these types of devices:

- OPNsense firewalls
- Home Assistant
- TP Link managed switches

It mocks out just enough for [LANsaver](https://github.com/edspencer/lansaver) to work against the endpoints.

It is unlikely that anyone else in the world will ever need to deploy this :)
